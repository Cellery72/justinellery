# JustinEllery
Hello there!
<br>
<br>
My name is Justin Ellery, I'm a student developer living/working out of London, Ontario Canada. 
This is the repo for my personal website that I'm currently working on. The intended use of the site is to generate interest in web development
services as well as provide brief information about myself to any possible future employers. It's going to be a basic one page site with a link 
to my wordpress blog and a brief contact form. The site is built with bootstrap to keep responsive web design in mind. I hope you enjoy the project,
it's a journey for me and I hope to learn a lot a long the way.

Feel free to send me an email (hello@elleryjustin.com) should you have any questions!

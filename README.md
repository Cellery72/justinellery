# JustinEllery

<br>
My name is Justin Ellery, I'm a student developer living/working out of London, Ontario Canada. 
This is the repo for my personal webapp. I'm hosting on a Droplet running Ubuntu 14.0, NGINX, NodeJS and MongoDB. Over time I'll be converting my static website I initally created based off of a Bootstrap template into a MEAN stack app to serve as a portfolio of the work I've created. Feel free to take a look at the code, I'm always looking for suggestions and criticism. I've learned a lot from school in a good OOP sense using languages like C++ and Java, I'm transferring this knowledge over in my free time to the web using Javascript.
